# Examples
Examples of IWXXM messages that comply with the OpenAPI schema. The examples are drawn from the [IWXXM repository examples](https://schemas.wmo.int/iwxxm/2023-1/examples/).

The JSON files have the same root name as the IWXXM repository file, but with extension _json_, for easy comparison with the corresponding TAC and XML versions.
